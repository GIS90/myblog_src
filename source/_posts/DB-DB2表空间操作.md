{% note primary %}
表空间对于DB2来说，就像一个容器，数据需要灌到这个容器里面。早上去项目，发现表空间报警提示马上满了，一定要提前扩容，不然数据库数据写不进去了。对表空间操作方式有2种：ADD与RESIZE。

<hr />

本项目使用的DB29.7版本，估计不同的版本表空间扩容都差不多。

#### 扩容表空间

DB2CMD中执行，先连上数据库：
```
su - db2inst1
db2 connect to ykspas3 user pas using pas
```

> 方式一：新增

```
db2 "alter tablespace TBS_IDX ADD (FILE '/home/db2inst1/YKSPAS3/PAS_DATA/PAS_SPACE_IDX/TBS_IDX3' 30G)"
```
文件改成项目对应的表空间实体文件。

> 方式二：调整

```
-- 调整【resize立马查看发生变化】
db2 "alter tablespace TBS_IDX RESIZE (file '/home/db2inst1/YKSPAS3/PAS_DATA/PAS_SPACE_IDX/TBS_IDX2' 50G)"
```

#### 表空间使用率

直接上SQL：
```
SELECT
	tbsp_id AS ID,
--	tbsp_create_time AS CREATE_TIME,
	tbsp_name as NAME,
	tbsp_content_type AS TYPE,
	tbsp_state AS STATE,
	sum(tbsp_total_size_kb)/1024 AS TOTAL_MB,
    sum(tbsp_used_size_kb)/1024 AS USED_MB,
    sum(tbsp_free_size_kb)/1024 AS FREE_MB,
    tbsp_page_size AS PAGE_SIZE
FROM SYSIBMADM.TBSP_UTILIZATION
--WHERE tbsp_name LIKE 'TBS_%'
GROUP BY tbsp_id, tbsp_create_time, tbsp_name, tbsp_content_type, tbsp_state, tbsp_page_size
ORDER BY tbsp_name
```

#### 其他查询表空间SQL

> 查看表空间

```
-- TBSP_UTILIZATION
SELECT * FROM SYSIBMADM.TBSP_UTILIZATION


-- SNAPTBSP
SELECT * FROM SYSIBMADM.SNAPTBSP

-- SNAPTBSP_PART
SELECT * FROM SYSIBMADM.SNAPTBSP_PART

-- SYSTABLESPACES
SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACES
```
具体的区别有兴趣的可以baidu，这里作为参考SQL。


#### 查看表空间列表

```
